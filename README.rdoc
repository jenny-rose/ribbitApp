== Ribbit App

My first dip into Ruby on Rails, using the Ribbit in Rails tutorial over at Net Tuts+. I felt a little lost. I knew nothing about Ruby before attempting this tutorial, except that it was wildly popular and that it didn't use brackets to create a visual hierarchy. Not to mention this is the first time I've actually combined code and HTML to create a working web app. I did, however, have some basic programming knowledge before diving in: types of data, variables, methods, arrays, loops, etc., so I was not without a (very skimpy) life vest. 

I had a lot of fun doing this, and I have no intention of leaving this as-is.
